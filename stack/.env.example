# 1. Authentication to db
DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME=testuser
DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD=changeme123

# 2. Resources for db
DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG=cisco

DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_RETENTION=365d

# 3. Authorization token for db operations
# Note: InfluxDB token regeneration may be needed when
# new credentials are used. Alternatively, change the credentials 
# from Influx's CLI by following these instructions:
# https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/admin/users/change-password.
#
# To generate a new token for InfluxDB, launch the InfluxDB service, 
# access its UI at <HOST_IP>:8086 and follow these guidelines:
# https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/create-token/
# Once ready, launch the Telegraf and Grafana services that will use the token 
# to perform read/write operations on the database.
